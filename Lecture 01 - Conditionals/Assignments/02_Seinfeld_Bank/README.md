# Home Federal Savings Bank

In [season 7, episode 24](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Invitations) of [Seinfeld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seinfeld), [Kramer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmo_Kramer) [visits a bank](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IN6cJ_wGmsk) that promises to give `$100` to anyone who isn’t greeted with a “hello.” Kramer is instead greeted with a “hey,” which he insists isn’t a “hello,” and so he asks for `$100`. The bank’s manager proposes a compromise: “You got a greeting that starts with an ‘h,’ how does `$20` sound?” Kramer accepts.


In a file called `bank.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a greeting. If the greeting starts starts with “hello”, output `$0`. If the greeting starts with an “h” (but not “hello”), output `$20`. Otherwise, output `$100`. Ignore any leading whitespace in the user’s greeting, and treat the user’s greeting case-insensitively.
