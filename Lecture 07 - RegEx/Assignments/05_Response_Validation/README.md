# Response Validation

When creating a Google Form that prompts users for a short answer (or paragraph), it’s possible to enable response validation and require that the user’s input match a regular expression. For instance, you could require that a user input an email address with a regex like this one:

    ^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+\/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?)*$

Or you could more easily use Google’s built-in support for validating an email address, per the screenshot below, much like you could use a library in your own code:

![form](./form.png)

In a file called `response.py`, using either [validator-collection](https://pypi.org/project/validator-collection/) or [validators](https://github.com/python-validators/validators) from PyPI, implement a program that prompts the user for an email address via `input` and then prints `Valid` or `Invalid`, respectively, if the input is a syntatically valid email address. You may not use `re`. And do not validate whether the email address’s domain name actually exists.
